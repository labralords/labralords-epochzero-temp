"c85f7c40-027a-11ed-8000-010000000000","iotapes.","***DISCLAIMER:** You DO NOT need to buy the NFT to become part of our community. Everyone who will respect our community guidelines is welcome to join our **[media channels](https://linktr.ee/iotapes)**.*\n\\n\\nKindly first **read more** about our project in this Medium post: https://iotapes.medium.com/about-us-6846092db31e\n\\n\\nOur NFT collection is made of 1074 unique apes. Each ape was randomly generated by combining 105 traits over 8 different categories. The designer of our collection is a great artist named **[BingoBongoApe](https://twitter.com/BingoBongo_ape)** aka “Macaulay Culkin” on our Discord server. Feel free to give him a shoutout when you see him, he has done a great job!\n\\n\\n**Fair launch.** All apes from the collection will be offered for sale. Whoever wants to join the NFT project will need to buy NFTs, even the founder himself. No NFTs will be held for “marketing”, “team” or any other purposes.\n\\n\\n100% of the proceeds from the NFT sales will go towards forming a treasury so each NFT owner is becoming a shareholder in our treasury and a DAO participant. Collection has **10% royalty fee** which goes to treasury as well.\n\\n\\nThe treasury will later be used to earn profits from the upcoming DeFi protocols on IOTA. All NFT owners decide on what to do with the treasury, i.e. distribute profits to holders or accumulate profits to increase the size of the treasury.\n\\n\\n**Floor price.** By setting up the collection as stated above, each NFT gets a “price floor” of 1/1074 * Treasury value. This is only a speculation and the actual market price of each NFT can be lower or higher than that.\n\\n\\n**Rarity.** Since the collection is generative, each ape will have a certain rarity score. If you are interested in apes with higher rarity score (rarer apes) then stay tuned to our Discord server because we will leak a tool to find out rarity a bit before the collection launches.\n\\n\\nRarity score was calculated by applying this method. https://raritytools.medium.com/ranking-rarity-understanding-rarity-calculation-methods-86ceaeb9b98c\n\\n\\nCheck rarity score via this tool: https://datastudio.google.com/s/geF-1oqWYYQ\n\\n\\n**No matter how rare or common your ape is they all have the SAME utility.**","soonaverse","0x3dfb05c0613f059c4ec2c4d848cddea26bd2b480",true,true,1074,1074,200000000,0.1,"2022-04-16T20:00:00.000Z","iotapes",,"2022-04-06T19:45:50.932Z","2022-04-17T08:13:30.220Z"

"0e35c030-027b-11ed-8000-010000000000","Sick Iota Apes mint","It was a long and arduous journey. But the time has finally come.\n\nA Limited Edition of 100 Sick Iota Apes especially for the community. There will be no more Apes. No ape was generated, each one is unique in shape, color, contours etc. They were drawn entirely by myself, as you can see, of course, it is a BAYC style. But it was deliberately adjusted so that it cannot count as a copy.\n\nYou wanted a mint, so your're getting one.\n\nI have tried to give each Ape a personal touch, sometimes rather simple, sometimes very elaborate. It's definitely not BAYC, just to make that clear.\n\nThe rights to the NFT goes to the buyer with the purchase. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.\n\nPlease note: This is just art. If you dont't like it, don't buy it. After this Collection i will make something totaly new.\n\nThank all of you guys","soonaverse","0xcc017d4752696f3d81ed65ebd565ed4053bf6feb",true,true,95,95,250000000,0.1,"2022-07-17T17:00:00.000Z","@SickIotaApes","SickIotaApes#4699","2022-07-12T15:43:34.068Z","2022-07-12T15:43:34.068Z"
"0e751320-027b-11ed-8000-010000000000","IOTAHOLICS (PRE-SALE)","Iotaholics is a NFT PFP designed exclusively for sale within the IOTA Tangle network through the new Soonaverse platform. This project has been made with the idea of helping to make this community bigger and to make the profits become part of the community, both in the form of future investments and in the form of prizes for the participants. Taking advantage of the worldwide impact that NFTs are having and with the novelty of IOTA in this field, we believe it is the right time for our project to move forward. We strongly believe in IOTA, and the fact of being from the beginning, as pioneers, will undoubtedly give our IOTAHOLICS an added value.\n\nWe have set some short term goals that you can check in our website: presence in social networks, creation of an iotaholics club, etc. But the biggest goal is as we said before, to contribute to enlarge the IOTA community. We also want to do something for the people who have bet on us, and the first step (small step) will be to distribute 50% of the profits from the sale of the NFTs among those who have invested in IOTAHOLICS. This will be done in the form of a raffle, the bases of which will be decided as soon as we see the participation and the amount of the prize. The rest will be reinvested in new projects, gifts and benefits for the iotaholics community, which we know that will grow more and more.\n\nFinally we want to thank you for being here, for being part of this project. And remember... there is no yesterday, tomorrow is far away! Buy now! :D","soonaverse","0xceb05094fb7f3f480ed299e35bb9e1a171484252",true,true,1000,1000,50000000,0.1,"2022-03-09T17:00:17.162Z","@iotaholics","mizaru#6627","2022-03-08T18:06:43.163Z","2022-03-08T18:06:43.163Z"
